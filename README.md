# Data-visualization-and-draw
It's a notebook summarizing the methods of data visualization that I've learned during the past months,which will be continued to update.The methods concerned with by now(20200910) are packages in python, such as matplotlib, seaborn and etc, and tikz in latex,and maybe include powerpoint.
I'd like to breakdown this notebook into three parts: Introduction, Drawing framework and characteristics. Sure,I can make some change if necessary in the future.
## Introduction
### Python packages
