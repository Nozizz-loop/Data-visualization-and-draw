# Data-visualization-and-draw
It's a notebook summarizing the methods of data visualization that I've learned during the past months,which will be continued to update.The methods concerned with by now(20200910) are packages in `python`, such as `matplotlib`, `seaborn` and etc, and `tikz` in `latex`,and maybe include `powerpoint`.
I'd like to breakdown this notebook into three parts: Introduction, Drawing framework and characteristics. Sure,I can make some change if necessary in the future.
## Introduction
### Python packages
When visualizing data using `python`, there are many packages can be useful.Usually, `numpy` and  `pandas` should be import initially for their function dealing with data sets.The choice of packages can be vary depended on what kind of figure to be drawed.`matplotlib.pyplot` is package transplanted from matlab, having the closed style with matlab in drawing. No doubt that `matplotlib` is a rather powerful tool for data visualization and it can depict almost all picture that you can imagine. Nevertheless, it may be cumbersome to draw some dynamic picture. I'll compare ads and disads of various packages later. As for seaborn, I'll talk about in the future.
